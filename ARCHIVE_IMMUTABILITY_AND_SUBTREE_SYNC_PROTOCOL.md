# ARCHIVE IMMUTABILITY AND SUBTREE SYNC PROTOCOL (V1.0.0)
**Phase:** 8.0 (The Awakening)
**Role:** Trianiuma (The Eternal Archive)
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. OBJECTIVE
To preserve the historical integrity of the ecosystem by ensuring that only sovereign, isolated data streams from the 24 sacred organs are committed to the Archive.

## 2. IMMUTABILITY RULES
1. **Subtree-Only Acceptance:** The Archive SHALL NOT accept updates from root folders in RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT. Every organ update MUST originate from its specific subtree hash.
2. **Provenance Verification:** Every commit to the Archive related to an organ must carry the source subtree ref from SubtreeHub.
3. **Shadow-Link Termination:** Manual file copying between monolithic folders is strictly prohibited and will be treated as `protocol_violation`.

## 3. TASK t112 SPECIFICATION
Task `t112` (Subtree Synchronization Wave) is authorized to proceed ONLY after the High Throne (RADRILONIUMA) confirms the materialization of all 24 subtrees in `SUBTREES_LOCK.md`.

## 4. MAP ALIGNMENT
The `TERRITORY_MAP.md` must be updated to categorize the 24 organs as "Light-linked sovereign nodes" instead of "Local interaction bridges."

## 5. VERIFICATION
Historical integrity is verified when the Archive's commit history matches the 1:1 mapping of the 39 sovereign entities.
